This note in short explains the different processes learning may take place in the brain. What I want is to inpisre some of these phenomenons in the field of AI and create some interesting neural neteorwks.

## why do we need to understand this?
I personally believe that the most of the world and major startups are stuck in the same loop of trainig LLMs while it is quite evident that it's a dead end. We might never reach the complexity of human brain using the transformers architecture. 

## Some things we can learn from biology
- Brain makes new connections based on experiences
- The synapses gets stronger when some sensory input triggers it frequently
- Memories are only stored in certain areas of brain and all neurons are not capable of storing memory
- A single neuron can interact with other neurons which are really far away and thus could move away from the tranditional approach of giving the neighouring nodes more importtance. 
- There are multiple connections between the same two neurons and the strength of the connection is decided by the freuqency of it's activation.

## Exploring them one by one
- **Making newer connections**: This topic is already explored by few papers and is known as the concept of "neurogenesis". I myself tired creating a framework of growing Neural Network using attention based mechanism and I will be sharing the results soon!
The idea here is that certain rules can be defined which neurons can either be added or connections can be pruned. Also, we need to design the framework in such a way that with just fewer training loops, we can re-train the network to adapt to the new connections and new knowledge.
