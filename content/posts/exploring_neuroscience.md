This note in short explains the different processes learning may take place in the brain. What I want is to inpisre some of these phenomenons in the field of AI and create some interesting neural neteorwks.

## why do we need to understand this?
I personally believe that the most of the world and major startups are stuck in the same loop of trainig LLMs while it is quite evident that it's a dead end. We might never reach the complexity of human brain using the transformers architecture. 

## Some things we can learn from biology
- Brain makes new connections based on experiences
- The synapses gets stronger when some sensory input triggers it frequently
- Memories are only stored in certain areas of brain and all neurons are not capable of storing memory
- A single neuron can interact with other neurons which are really far away and thus could move away from the tranditional approach of giving the neighouring nodes more importtance.
