## _**What are Cellular Automata?**_

Cellular Automata are a type of model where certain cells are represented as grids and each cell has a state. The state of these cells are time variant. The current state of a cell will be a function of the states of it's neighbouring cell's states. This function can also be defined as a set of rules instead. In the early model, the states of the cells were binary (0 or 1) but now they can be any value between them. This can exponentially increase the complexity of the model and thus can be used to represent complex adaptive or collaborative systems.
